### Install dependencies (from Polymer Starter Kit)

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd polymer-starter-kit && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download ***JDK*** and install it.

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.


## Unit Testing

Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience.

[Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#html-suites) about using Web Component tester.

## Dependency Management

Polymer uses [Bower](http://bower.io) for package management. This makes it easy to keep your elements up to date and versioned. For tooling, we use npm to manage Node.js-based dependencies.

## Service Worker

Polymer Starter Kit offers an optional offline experience thanks to Service Worker and the [Platinum Service Worker elements](https://github.com/PolymerElements/platinum-sw). New to Service Worker? Read the following [introduction](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/) to understand how it works.

Our optional offline setup should work well for relatively simple applications. For more complex apps, we recommend learning how Service Worker works so that you can make the most of the Platinum Service Worker element abstractions.

### Enable Service Worker support?

To enable Service Worker support for Polymer Starter Kit project use these 3 steps:

1. Uncomment Service Worker code in index.html
  ```HTML
  <!-- Uncomment next block to enable Service Worker support (1/2) -->
  <!--
  <paper-toast id="caching-complete"
               duration="6000"
               text="Caching complete! This app will work offline.">
  </paper-toast>

  <platinum-sw-register auto-register
                        clients-claim
                        skip-waiting
                        on-service-worker-installed="displayInstalledToast">
    <platinum-sw-cache default-cache-strategy="networkFirst"
                       precache-file="precache.json">
    </platinum-sw-cache>
  </platinum-sw-register>
  -->
  ```
2. Uncomment Service Worker code in elements.html

  ```HTML
  <!-- Uncomment next block to enable Service Worker Support (2/2) -->
  <!--
  <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/platinum-sw/platinum-sw-cache.html">
  <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/platinum-sw/platinum-sw-register.html">
  -->
  ```
3. Uncomment 'cache-config' in the `runSequence()` section of the 'default' gulp task, like below:
[(gulpfile.js)](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/gulpfile.js)

  ```JavaScript
  // Build Production Files, the Default Task
  gulp.task('default', ['clean'], function (cb) {
    runSequence(
      ['copy', 'styles'],
      'elements',
      ['jshint', 'images', 'fonts', 'html'],
      'vulcanize', 'cache-config',
      cb);
  });
  ```
